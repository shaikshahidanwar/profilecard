        <p>General Anil Chauhan PVSM UYSM AVSM SM VSM (born 18 May 1961) is a four-star general of the Indian Army, who is the current and 2nd Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) of the Indian Armed Forces, since 30 September 2022.[2][3]

On 28 September 2022, Gen Chauhan was recalled from retirement and was appointed as Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) by the Narendra Modi-led government, following a June 2022 notification which permitted military retirees under the age of 62 to be qualified for the post.[4] Assuming charge two days later, he became the first three-star retiree to be appointed to the post, traditionally held by a four-star officer.[4] He succeeded General Bipin Rawat, the inaugural holder of the post, who had died in a helicopter crash in December 2021.[5]</p>
